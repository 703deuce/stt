# 🎯 Complete Signup & Payment Workflows

## Overview

Your app now has **3 distinct signup paths** based on what the user chooses:

1. **FREE Trial** → Sign up for free (no payment)
2. **Paid Plans** → Sign up + pay immediately
3. **Login** → Existing users sign in

   }
   ```

## 🔍 How to Tell Which Path User Took

### **In Firestore:**

**Free Trial User:**
```typescript
{
  email: "trial@example.com",
  subscriptionStatus: "trial",
  trial: {
    isActive: true,
    minutesTotal: 90,
    minutesUsed: 0
  }
  // NO stripeCustomerId
}
```

**Paid User (Direct Signup):**
```typescript
{
  email: "paid@example.com",
  subscriptionStatus: "active",
  subscriptionPlan: "solo",
  stripeCustomerId: "cus_xxx",
  stripeSubscriptionId: "sub_xxx"
  // NO trial object
}
```

**Trial User Who Upgraded:**
```typescript
{
  email: "upgraded@example.com",
  subscriptionStatus: "active",
  subscriptionPlan: "solo",
  trial: {
    hasEnded: true,  // Trial ended when they paid
    minutesUsed: 45
  },
  stripeCustomerId: "cus_xxx",
  stripeSubscriptionId: "sub_xxx"
}
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### **Why 3 Separate Paths?**
1. **Reduces friction** for trial users (no payment info)
2. **Clarity** - users know what they're getting
3. **Conversion** - paid users skip trial, get immediate access
4. **Flexibility** - supports both free-to-paid and direct purchase

### **Why Single-Page Signup + Payment?**
- **Less abandonment** - fewer steps = higher conversion
- **Transparency** - user sees plan details while signing up
- **Trust** - everything happens in one flow
- **Modern UX** - matches SaaS best practices (Notion, Linear, etc.)
