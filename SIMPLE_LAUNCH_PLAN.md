# ⚡ Simple Launch Plan - STT Only

**Bottom Line**: You're 5 days away from launch. Here's exactly what to do.

---

## ✅ What Works Right Now

- Transcription system (upload → transcribe → view → export)
- Landing page & dashboard
- Authentication
- All UI components
- `.env.local` configured

**The product works. You just can't charge for it yet.**

---

## ❌ What's Missing (2 Things)

### 1. Stripe Payment System
**Why**: Can't charge users without it  
**Time**: 2 days  
**Effort**: Copy-paste from implementation guide

### 2. Trial Tracking
**Why**: Landing page promises "7 days + 90 minutes free"  
**Time**: 2 days  
**Effort**: Add trial object to user signup, track minutes
