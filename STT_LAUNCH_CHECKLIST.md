## 🔴 CRITICAL: What's Missing for Launch

### 1. Payment System (2 days)
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Why Critical**: Can't charge users without this

**What You Need**:
- Stripe checkout flow
- Subscription management
- Webhook handling
- User subscription status in Firestore

**Pricing** (from your landing page):
- Solo Unlimited: $17.99/month
- Team Unlimited: $12.99/month (min 3 users)
- Agency Unlimited: $10.99/month (min 10 users)

**Implementation**: See `QUICK_START_IMPLEMENTATION.md` Phase 2

---

### 2. Free Trial System (2 days)
**Status**: Landing page only, backend not implemented  
**Why Critical**: Landing page promises "7 days + 90 minutes free"

**Your Promise** (from landing page):
- 7-day free trial
- 90 minutes of transcription
- No credit card required
- Full feature access

**What You Need**:
```typescript
// On user signup, initialize trial:
{
  trial: {
    isActive: true,
    startDate: now,
    endDate: now + 7 days,
    minutesUsed: 0,
    minutesTotal: 90,
    hasEnded: false
  },
  subscriptionStatus: 'trial'
}
```

**Flow**:
1. User signs up → Trial starts automatically
2. User transcribes → Minutes deducted from 90
3. Trial ends (7 days OR 90 minutes) → Show upgrade modal
4. User upgrades → Unlimited access

**Implementation**: See `QUICK_START_IMPLEMENTATION.md` Phase 3

---

### 3. Firebase Security Rules (30 min)
**Status**: Likely using default rules  
**Why Important**: Database security

**Current Risk**: Users might be able to access other users' data

**Fix**: Apply proper security rules (see Phase 4 in implementation guide)

---

### 4. Deployment (1 hour)
**Status**: Not deployed  
**Why Important**: Need public URL to launch

**Recommended**: Vercel (easiest for Next.js)

**Steps**:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy
5. Configure Stripe webhook for production URL

## 🎯 What You're NOT Doing (For Now)

These features exist in the UI but **skip for STT-only launch**:

### Not Needed for Launch:
- ~~TTS (Text-to-Speech)~~ - Already built, just not marketing it
- ~~Voice Cloning~~ - Already built, just not marketing it
- ~~Voice Transfer~~ - Already built, just not marketing it
- ~~Voice Gallery~~ - Already built, just not marketing it
- ~~Email notifications~~ - Can add post-launch
- ~~Advanced admin features~~ - Basic stats are enough
- ~~User settings page~~ - Can use Firebase Console
- ~~Analytics~~ - Add Google Analytics only

### Leave Features in UI:
- Keep the sidebar links (just don't promote them)
- Keep the TTS/cloning pages working
- Focus marketing ONLY on transcription
- Can upsell TTS later to existing customers

**Strategy**: Launch lean with STT, validate market, then add TTS as "new feature" later.

---

## 💰 Revenue Focus: STT Pricing

### Your Competitive Advantage:
- **30-40% cheaper** than Otter.ai, Transkriptor, Sembly
- **True unlimited** (no hidden caps)
- **Monthly billing** (no annual lock-in)
- **Advanced features** (diarization, word timestamps)

### Your STT Features to Promote:
1. ✅ Unlimited transcription (no minute caps)
2. ✅ Speaker diarization (identify who spoke)
3. ✅ Word-level timestamps
4. ✅ 50+ languages
5. ✅ Batch processing
6. ✅ Multiple export formats
7. ✅ AI summaries & chat
8. ✅ Secure cloud storage

### Landing Page Updates Needed:
- ✅ Already done! Your landing page is STT-focused
- ✅ Hero mentions "Audio Transcription"
- ✅ Features highlight STT capabilities
- ✅ Pricing is transcription-focused

**No changes needed to landing page!** It's already STT-focused. 🎉

Now you just need to:
1. Let people pay you (Stripe)
2. Give them a free trial (trial tracking)
3. Put it online (Vercel)

**That's literally it.**

No need to overcomplicate. Launch simple, iterate fast, grow based on real feedback.

**You can launch by this weekend.** I believe in you! 💪

Good luck! 🎉
